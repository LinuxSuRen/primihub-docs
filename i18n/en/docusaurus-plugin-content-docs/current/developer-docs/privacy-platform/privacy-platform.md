# Management platform Architecture
![primihub frame](/img/primihub_frame.png) 

At present, various business parties (including gateway, service and node) share resources to different central nodes (fusion), and then perform data replication, audit and authentication through their respective business parties' gateways, and finally notify multi-party nodes for tasks such as federated computing and MPC.

Since the services of each business party are independently deployed, and the data shared is only a brief introduction of the data, and the real data will not be leaked, a series of secure operations of private computing are guaranteed through the execution of node node tasks.
